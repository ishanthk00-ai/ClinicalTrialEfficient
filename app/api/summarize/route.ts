Eligibility criteria (raw):
${eligibilityCriteria ?? "Not provided"}

Please respond with a JSON object (no markdown, just the raw JSON) with exactly these fields:

{
  "plainSummary": "3-4 sentences in plain English explaining what this trial is studying and why it matters to patients. No jargon.",
  "qualify": ["bullet 1", "bullet 2", "..."],
  "notQualify": ["bullet 1", "bullet 2", "..."],
  "involved": "2-3 sentences describing what participation looks like: how long the study runs, roughly how many visits or procedures, and what participants actually do."
}

For qualify and notQualify: extract the most important criteria from the eligibility text above. Each bullet should be a complete, plain-English sentence starting with a condition (e.g. "You have been diagnosed with...", "You are between 18 and 65 years old"). Include 3-6 bullets per list. If criteria are not available, return empty arrays.`;
